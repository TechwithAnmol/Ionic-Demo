# Jenkinsfile for Ionic Demo Project

This repository contains a Jenkinsfile for automating the build, test, and deployment processes of an Ionic demo project using Jenkins.

## Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkinsfile defines a declarative pipeline with stages for:

1. **Checkout**: Checks out the repository code.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Installs Node.js and Ionic CLI, and installs project dependencies.
3. **Build**: Builds the Ionic project.
4. **Test**: Runs tests (if applicable).
5. **Deploy**: Deploys the Ionic project (e.g., to Firebase, AWS, etc.).

## Usage

To use this Jenkinsfile for your Ionic project:

1. **Create a Jenkins Job**: Set up a Jenkins job with a pipeline configuration.
2. **Pipeline from SCM**: Configure the job to use this repository as the SCM (Source Control Management) and specify the Jenkinsfile location.
3. **Run the Pipeline**: Trigger the Jenkins job to run the pipeline, which will automate the build, test, and deployment processes for your Ionic project.
